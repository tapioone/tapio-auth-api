This is a reference implementation of **Basic Authentication with AuthorizationKey** against the tapio APIs (Tadamo, Maintenance Service).  
AuthorizationKeys are generated from tapio add-ons (ERP, Measurement Systems, ToolManager Office) and can be used to access APIs without registering separate Azure AD applications.
